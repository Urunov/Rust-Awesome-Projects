Maybe you don't want to install Rust yet, and that's okay. You can go to https://play.rust-lang.org/ and start writing Rust without leaving your browser. You can write your code there and click Run to see the results. 

### Part-1. Getting Started
  *  1.1 [Installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
       - It looks like youâ€™re running `macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS`. To download Rustup and install Rust, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions.
            -  `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
       - CLI installation result (MAC OS represents_)

 * 1.9 `Loop` 
 
A for loop lets you tell `Rust` what to do each time. But in a for loop, the loop stops after a certain number of times. for loops use ranges very often. You use .. and `..= ` to create a range.

       * .. creates an exclusive range: 0..3 creates 0, 1, 2.
       * ..= creates an inclusive range: 0..=3 = 0, 1, 2, 3.
